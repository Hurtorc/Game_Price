# GAME PRICE CHECKER

## Description
We've developed an app to allocate pricing of video games based on user's designated region.
The search bar allows the input of the video game you're trying to purchase.
Submit button will bring up locations with pricing and top rated games. The search bar will suggest games based on user's initial input. This makes frugal shopping fun, simple, and effective if you're trying to compare pricing and distance from user's area.


## Installation

N/A

## USAGE

User will type in video game title in the search bar and designate a region. The 'Let's Go!' button will allocate pricing in that area and provide the name and address of the store. When typing in the initial letter  of the game you're searching for, a list of games beginning with that letter will pop up. This will make it easier to find or possibly advise other games with similiar names. We've also added a great Spotify playlist of synthesizer tracks while you search for your item. The user will enjoy the experience of shopping while getting the feel of an 80's escapism.
