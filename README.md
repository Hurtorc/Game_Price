# GAME PRICE CHECKER

We've developed an app to allocate pricing of video games based on user's designated region.
The search bar allows the input of the video game you're trying to purchase.
Submit button will bring up locations with pricing and top rated games.

## Installation

N/A

## USAGE

User will type in video game title in the search bar and desginate a region. The 'Let's Go!' button will allocate pricing in that area and provide the name and address of the store. This makes frugal shopping easy and effective if you're trying to compare pricing and distance from user's area.
